Providing better confidentiality and authentication on the Internet using Namecoin and MinimaLT
=======

In this paper, we introduce a duo of improvements for the Internet that would lead to better security. The authentication model on the Internet is broken and TLS connections have a considerable overhead. We try to address those issues with changes in both the application layer, discussing a replacement for the DNS system, and in the transport layer, a drop-in replacement for TCP built on top of UDP so that it can run on today's internet infrastructure.
